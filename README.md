# Tank Game

The one and probably not only **tank game.**

The game works by having the barrel and base turn on their own, allowing movement and aiming to be separate  
  
These controls may feel wonky at first but...  
Yeah no they always feel wonky

## Player 1

`A and D` to turn base  
`W and S` to move forward and back  
`Q and E` to turn barrel  
`R` to fire

## Player 2

`J and L` to turn base  
`I and K` to move forward and back  
`U and O` to turn barrel  
`P` to fire  

## How to play

Kill the enemy tank by shooting it with bullets until it dies. I probably didn't need to explain that to you but it's here if you need it ðŸ™ƒ

## Requirements

- A working computer (important that it does work)
- A friend (we all know you have none)
