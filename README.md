# tank-game

The one and probably not only **tank game.**

The game works by having the barrel and base turn on their own, allowing movement and aiming to be separate

## Player 1

`A and D` to turn base  
`W and S` to move forward and back  
`Q and E` to turn barrel  
`R` to fire

## Player 2

`J and L` to turn base  
`I and K` to move forward and back  
`U and O` to turn barrel  
`P` to fire  

## How to play

Kill the enemy tank by shooting it with bullets until it dies. I probably didn't need to explain that to you but it's here if you need it ðŸ™ƒ
